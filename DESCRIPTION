Description: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal provides a
        platform for researchers to search, download, and analyze data
        sets generated by TCGA. It contains clinical information,
        genomic characterization data, and high level sequence analysis
        of the tumor genomes. The key is to understand genomics to
        improve cancer care. RTCGA package offers download and
        integration of the variety and volume of TCGA data using
        patient barcode key, what enables easier data possession. This
        may have an benefcial infuence on impact on development of
        science and improvement of patients' treatment. Furthermore,
        RTCGA package transforms TCGA data to tidy form which is
        convenient to use.
